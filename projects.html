      <p>A buddy and I are launching a coworking space in Bloomington, IN.  It started out as the two of us looking for office space to share and now it's grown to 10+ people sharing a space and a full blown coworking space.  We plan on putting on training events as well.</p>
      <p>I've even built 6 of the desks from local rough cut red oak lumber into <a href="http://cl.ly/image/13111x0I3d2M">finished desks</a>.</p>
      <p>Also built a <a href="http://coworkbtown.com/rollcall.html">Roll Call</a> page with Instagram integration so members can post pictures to the site right from Instagram.</p>

      <h3>Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry</h3>
      <small>logo design - jekyll - website design/development</small>
      <p>This site is still a work in progress so no site to share just yet.  I'm building this out with Jekyll and doing a redesign from the ground up.  WordPress was over kill for them and I always update the site for them anyway so I figured I'd use something I'm most comfortable in.  So Jekyll/github pages it was.</p>

      <h3>Denver Mapping Prototype</h3>
      <small>front end development - ui design</small>
      <p>This was a quick weekend project to help out my buddy who works at a small start up.</p>
      <p>My primary roll was to get some quick prototypes together that they could implement into their app.  I used font awesome, animate.css and Twitter Bootstrap to achieve this as quickly as possible and leave them with a nice framework to move forward.</p>
      <p><strong>Prototyping:</strong> HTML, CSS3, <a href="http://daneden.me/animate/">animate.css</a>, <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a></p>

      <p>I was brought on as a UI/UX Design consultant for this project.  They had plenty of developers and no designers so they only required my design help.  I worked with the product manager and developers to lead the design of the site.</p>

      <p>The Viddler marketing site was in fairly rough shape when I first started.  They home page was a big pain point for everyone so this was a big update to the site.  We are making an effort to humanize our product by showing customers in the banner.  It also shows some of our best features for different markets.</p>

      <p>Viddler offers an amazing set of Add-ons but unfortunatly our <a href="http://viddler.com/addons">current Add-ons page</a> doesn't reflect that.  This in progress re-design is an attempt to better show our add-ons and increase sales.</p>

      <p>Our ever evolving plans page is always changing as it should be.  In our latest version we've added the Advantage plan.</p>
      <p>Another key part of this page is the customer spotlight slider toward the bottom of the page.  Once updating the plans page we saw immediate icrease in our sales.</p>

      <p>We are often needing landing pages for specific markets.  I designed and developed a set of landing pages that have background video banners and a design that is streamlined for user signups.</p>

      <a href="http://www.bootstrapinator.com/" class="visit">visit page</a>
      <p>This was a fun side project I did with Rafter's own <a href="http://brendansaunders.me/">Brendan Saunders</a>.  We noticed that so many sites started to use Twitter's Bootstrap framework that many sites where starting to look the same.  So we made a theme that could be dropped over top any bootstrap app and it would look totally different.  We haven't maintained the project like we'd hoped but it was a great learning experience for both of us.</p>

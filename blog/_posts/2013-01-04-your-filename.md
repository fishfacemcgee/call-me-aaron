Working Remote is the Bomb

A year and a half ago I left my corporate job and some how managed to get a solid raise and maintain amazing benefits.  After a year at that company it was time for me to leave and I managed to find another amazing job with amazing benefits.  This time it was with a high profile tech company working with some amazing people.  But probably the most amazing part of this time after leaving my corporate job was that I was able to stayed in my home town that I love so dearly.

This is why I think remote working is the bomb.

Searching Authentic jobs, dribble and others I'm consistently amazed at the remote oportunites that are available.  I feel so lucky to be living in this time where I can do what I love and work for conceivably any company.  This type of oportunity has only been possible in the past few years.

What makes this possible?
-------------------------

Google.  In one word Google has made much of this possible.  Between google docs, hangouts, chat, gmail and everything else they've created the perfect suite for remote teams.

There are a ton of other players in the game too that only make it better.

Skype is an amazing tool that has a great breath of features for free.  They also have the most tallented animated gif team on the internet.  Hands down.  No question about it.

Wireframing tools are in no short supply.  Balsamiq lead the charge in this field but there are many others now.  Not sure any have nailed it home but there are plenty of options here.

Basecamp is one of my all in one favorites.  There are a lot of haters here and in my experience if someone has had one bad experience with basecamp they hate it.  But when it's used to it's fullest it is amazing.

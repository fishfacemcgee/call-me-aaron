    <h3>Designer</h3>
    <p>I am a designer who loves solving problems. I believe in user focused design and interfaces that are fun and easy to use. I love working each element on the screen to a pixel perfect design and then taking that and putting it into smart, rock solid markup.</p>

  <div class="four columns">
    <h3>Developer</h3>
    <p>I'm a solid front-end developer who's been working with developers in Ruby on Rails and other MVC frameworks for over five years.  I excel at rapid prototyping and iterative development specializing in HTML/CSS/JS. </p>

    <h3>Builder</h3>
    <p>I like to call myself a builder.  No matter what I need, weather it's a new feature in an app that requires a new technology that I need to learn, or a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/WlAOkGkn0c/">desk for a coworking space</a>, I find a way to build it.</p>

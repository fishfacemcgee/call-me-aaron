    <h3>Learn</h3>
    <p>The need to learn is part of our human nature.  If we stop learning, we stop living.  This is ever so true in the world of design and development.  Never stop learning.  Never.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="four columns">
    <h3>Try</h3>
    <p>I've often wondered what my true passion is as I often have a latest and greatest hobbie.  Recently I realized my passion is trying new things, in life and in design.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="four columns">
    <h3>Build</h3>
    <p>Last, but most definitely the most important.  Just build.  Buy creating things you will be forced to learn and try new things that will advance you further than anything.  Just build stuff!</p>

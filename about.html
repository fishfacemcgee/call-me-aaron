    <p>I am a designer who loves solving problems. I believe in user focused design and interfaces that are fun and easy to use. I love working each element on the screen to a pixel perfect design and then taking that and putting it into smart, rock solid markup.</p>

    <p>I believe that great design looks great but isn’t slapping you across the face. I know that utility should always be at the forefront of design while paying just as much attention to the tiniest of details.</p>

    <p>First and foremost I love my wife and two kids. They are the root of everything I do.</p>

    <p>I’m a total sports nut. I love to play sports, watch sports (go IU), play sports video games… sports sports sports. Golf is my most recent obsession but if I had to pick one sport I’d have to say football is “my sport”… or maybe basketball.</p>
